This causes issues in prediction what our data is higher variance because our error will rise.\n","\n","- High bias models are like people with stereotypes about the world based on little data: they need to be more flexible because they aren't basing their choices on the data.\n","\n","- They tend to perform well on the training data but poorly on unseen data (underfitting).\n","\n","**Variance:**\n","\n","- When we choose a model that is overly flexible, we run the risk of memorizing our data and overfitting it. This is the phenomenon of high variance. A model with high variance has learned the noise in the training data, making it overly sensitive to fluctuations and likely to model the random noise in the training data.\n","\n","**Bias-Variance Tradeoff:**\n","- The bias-variance tradeoff is the tradeoff between a model's ability to generalize well to new data (low variance) and its ability to fit the training data well (low bias).\n","- Ideally, a model should have low bias and low variance, but in practice, reducing bias may increase variance and vice versa. This tradeoff highlights the challenge of finding a model with just the right amount of flexibility to capture the underlying structure of the data while still generalizing well to new, unseen data.\n","- The goal is to find a good balance that minimizes the total error, which is the sum of bias, variance, and irreducible error."],"metadata":{"id":"wLw5U7NrA3x_"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Question 2: Encoding Text Variables**\n","\n","You are provided the following data on tipping behavior at restaurants.
