Load the `Fund` data from the ISLP package [here](https://islp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/datasets/Fund.html). Assign it to the variable `fund`. This is information about the managers I pay to trade my money around. I suspect that some are making systemically great trades. I want you to identify them. (1pt)\n","\n","- b. Take the median of every fund manager. *sort* the *values*. Assign this result to the variable `median_vals`. run `describe` on `median_vals`. Assign it to the variable `dist` and display its results. (2pts)\n","\n","\n","- c. The `Empirical Rule`, or the `68-95-99.7 Rule`, says that around 68% of results should lie within 1 standard deviation of the mean, around 95% of scores within 2 standard deviations of the mean, and around 99.7% of scores should lie within 3 standard deviations of the mean, if we assume a normal distribution.\n","\n","  Assign the `mean` from `dist` to variable `mu`, and assign standard deviation from `dist` to the variable `sig`.

Filter `median_vals` down to only include data that is greater than `three_sig_above`. Display who the overperformers are by printing out the filtered `median_vals` results.
