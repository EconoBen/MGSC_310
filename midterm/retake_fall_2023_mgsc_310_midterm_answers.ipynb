Assign it to the `credit` variable. Create a target variable for us: whenever the column `Limit` is above 6000 assign a 1, otherwise assign a 0. Assign these results to a new column: `is_high`. (2pts)\n","- b. Create new features for us. In the `Gender` column map those who are assigned ' Male' to 1 and those who are assigned 'Female' 0. Assign the new data to the column `is_male` (2pts). Hint: The Male column has a typo...\n","- c. Create another new feature column. In the `Education` column assign values 16 and above to 1, and all other values to 0. Assign the results to the new column `is_educated`. (2pts)\n","- d. Run a train_test_split on the credit dataset. The feature data should be: `'Income', 'Rating', 'Cards', 'Age', 'Education', 'Balance', 'is_male', 'is_educated' `. The target should be `is_high` from above. The test_size should be .17. The data should be shuffled and a `random_state` integer should be given so I can recreate your work. (2pts)\n","- e. Run a [LogisticRegression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) on your `X_train` and `y_train` data. Then predict on your `X_test` data. (2pts)\n","- f. Run a [confusion matrix](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix.html) on your results. Interpret your results for me. Interpret every cell in the matrix. (4pts)\n","- g. Run an [ROC/AUC score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score.html#sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score) on your data. Are the results good? How do you know? Would you put this model into production in the real world? Why or why not? Intepret the AUC value for us.
